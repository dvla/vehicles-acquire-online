# Routes
# This file defines all application routes (Higher priority routes first)
# ~~~~

# IoC
# For those controllers whose dependencies are being injected, we use the @controllers syntax here so that
# the router knows we are referring to a class (not an object). In turn it will call on the
# GlobalSettings.getControllerInstance method to resolve the actual controller instance. This method hooks into
# Guice to provide the actual instance complete with its injected dependencies
